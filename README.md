# Project-DAWN

## High-Level Summary
Our project **DAWN** is an innovative agricultural monitoring platform that integrates IoT and satellite data to provide farmers with real-time insights, predictive analytics, and actionable recommendations. We developed a solution that allows farmers to monitor key environmental metrics—such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and pH levels—using IoT sensors. Additionally, the platform uses Earth observation data to analyze crop health through indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Moisture Mapping, enhancing farm management decisions.

### How It Addresses the Challenge:
DAWN leverages Earth observation data and IoT technology to provide informed agricultural decision-making. Satellite data is processed to give farmers a clear picture of their field conditions from a macro perspective, while IoT sensors offer micro-level, real-time data. This combination allows farmers to:
- Predict crop health and yield.
- Identify potential environmental or disease-related issues early.
- Optimize resource usage based on accurate soil and weather data.
- Make proactive, data-driven decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.

### Why It’s Important:
With increasing challenges due to climate change, unpredictable weather, and resource scarcity, farming has become more complex and risk-prone. DAWN empowers farmers by offering them powerful tools to manage these uncertainties, optimize their farming practices, and adopt more sustainable and resilient methods. By utilizing Earth observation data, farmers can take a broader and more precise approach to farm management, ultimately improving food security and reducing environmental impact globally.

## Project Details

Our project, **DAWN**, is an advanced agricultural monitoring and decision-making platform that leverages IoT and AI technologies to optimize farming practices and sustainability. It integrates real-time IoT sensors and satellite data to monitor essential farm metrics such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, soil and water pH, and more. The platform processes this data using machine learning to detect anomalies, recommend actions, and predict future conditions, helping farmers make informed decisions.

### How It Works:
1. **IoT Monitoring**: Sensors installed on the farm collect real-time data on various environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH levels, etc. This data is automatically uploaded to the DAWN platform.
2. **Anomaly Detection & Alerts**: Machine learning models analyze the data to detect unusual trends or anomalies that could indicate potential issues, such as plant diseases or environmental stress.
3. **IoT Expense Calculator**: The platform helps farmers calculate the cost of implementing IoT solutions by allowing them to input field size and select specific services needed for their farm.
4. **Dashboard Insights & Task Recommendations**: Based on weather data and historical farm monitoring, DAWN recommends daily tasks for optimal farm management.
5. **Farming Simulator & Layout Optimization**: The simulator allows users to interact with virtual farm layouts, providing recommendations for the best layout based on the specific crops, farm size, and farming goals. It also lets users simulate various scenarios to assess farm resilience.
6. **Farming Assistance & Carbon Farming**: The platform provides personalized recommendations for crops, fertilizers, and carbon-friendly agricultural practices. It can also detect plant growth stages, predict yield, and diagnose plant diseases and pests using data and imagery.
7. **Satellite Image Analysis**: DAWN offers satellite-based analysis of crops using indices such as NDVI, Soil Moisture Mapping, and Green Leaf Index to provide insights into crop health and sustainability.
8. **Exoplanet Exploration**: DAWN includes an interactive space exploration feature, allowing users to join virtual journeys to explore exoplanets with friends and learn about space science.

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: By analyzing data, DAWN helps farmers make informed decisions about planting, fertilizing, and harvesting, which can increase yield and sustainability.
- **Sustainability**: By promoting carbon farming practices and optimizing farm layouts, DAWN helps farmers contribute to environmental conservation.
- **Cost Savings**: The IoT expense calculator helps farmers understand the costs of upgrading their farms with modern technology, helping them make smarter financial decisions.
- **Education & Engagement**: The exoplanet exploration feature brings a fun and educational component to the platform, engaging users with space science while using farming technology.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence:
Yes, we utilized multiple Artificial Intelligence tools and software in preparing DAWN:

1. **TensorFlow and Keras**: These were used to build and train machine learning models for anomaly detection, plant disease identification, crop yield prediction, and other farming-related AI tasks. Keras provided a high-level API for designing and fine-tuning models, while TensorFlow served as the backend for handling the computational workloads.
   
2. **Ultralytics**: This library, known for its YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, was used for object detection tasks, such as detecting plant growth stages, identifying pests, and diagnosing diseases from images. It allowed us to implement real-time visual analysis in the farming assistance module.
   
3. **CV2 (OpenCV)**: OpenCV was integrated to process and analyze images, particularly for tasks like satellite image analysis (e.g., NDVI and Soil Moisture Mapping) and plant health detection from on-field cameras. It provided pre-processing capabilities to enhance image quality before feeding them into AI models.

4. **Ollama**: Ollama was used as a conversational AI tool for our chatbot feature, which allows users to interact with the system, ask questions, and get farm-related guidance. The AI chatbot helped users understand and navigate through the farm layout and IoT data insights.

By integrating these AI technologies, we ensured that our project could offer advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and intelligent decision-making tools for farmers, addressing both macro and micro agricultural challenges effectively.
